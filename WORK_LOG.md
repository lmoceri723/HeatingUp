| 1/16 | 10:55-11:25 | I planned out an approach where I would use an array to keep track of the amount of elements lower than each index in the original array, allowing me to do just one passthrough (no work to commit). |
| 1/16 | 11:30-11:50 |                                                              I started coding my approach, getting about half of it done. I've initialized everything and now just have to write the core logic loop. |
| 1/21 |  7:40-8:10  |                              I wrote the loop of my function, checking backwards in my map from each temp value to find the longest possible sequence length. I tested my code and it works in 50 ms. |
